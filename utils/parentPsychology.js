          challenge: 'Sometimes children need more structure than you naturally provide',
          insight: 'Your trust in their autonomy is beautiful, but some children (especially those with attention challenges) thrive with gentle scaffolding. Structure can actually increase their sense of autonomy by giving them tools to succeed.',

        {
          challenge: 'You may avoid addressing real reading difficulties',
          insight: 'Your hands-off approach can sometimes mask a child\'s genuine struggle with decoding or comprehension. Respecting autonomy doesn\'t mean ignoring learning gaps.',

        {
          challenge: 'Children may interpret your restraint as lack of interest',
          insight: 'Your respectful distance can sometimes feel like disengagement to children who crave your enthusiasm about their interests.',
          growthAction: 'Share your genuine excitement about their discoveries. Enthusiasm isn\'t the same as control.'

    },
    
    researchInsight: {
      core: 'Your approach aligns with Self-Determination Theory\'s finding that autonomy is one of three basic psychological needs. Research consistently shows that autonomy-supportive environments enhance intrinsic motivation, creativity, and well-being.',
      caution: 'However, research also shows that autonomy support works best when combined with appropriate structure and warmth. Pure permissiveness can actually undermine children\'s sense of security.'

    psychologicalCore: {
      unconsciousDrive: 'You\'re motivated by wanting children to feel genuinely capable, not just praised. You may have experienced the satisfaction of mastering difficult things, or felt the frustration of being in over your head without proper support.',
      
      dailyBehaviors: [
        'When your child struggles, you immediately start thinking about what skill or support they need',
        'You notice and comment on specific improvements: "You read that word without sounding it out!"',
        'You feel satisfied when you can help a child breakthrough a learning barrier',

    researchInsight: {
      core: 'Your approach aligns with Bandura\'s self-efficacy research, showing that beliefs about capability strongly predict motivation and achievement. Competence is indeed one of the three basic psychological needs in Self-Determination Theory.',
      caution: 'Research also shows that competence support works best when it feels supportive rather than evaluative. Children need to feel that their worth isn\'t tied to their performance.'

    emoji: 'ü§ù',
    color: '#EB2F96',

          challenge: 'You may not recognize when children need reading independence',
          insight: 'Your desire for connection is beautiful, but some children process stories internally and feel interrupted by too much discussion. Some need solitary reading time to fully engage.',
          growthAction: 'Learn to read the cues. Ask "Would you like to tell me about your book, or do you want to keep it private for now?" Honor both answers.'
        },
        {
          challenge: 'You might feel rejected when children prefer reading alone',
          insight: 'Independent reading isn\'t a rejection of you - it\'s often a sign that children have internalized your love of books and are developing their own relationship with reading.',

        },
        {
          challenge: 'You may overwhelm reluctant readers with enthusiasm',
          insight: 'Your excitement about books can sometimes feel like pressure to children who are struggling or reluctant. They may feel like they\'re disappointing you.',
          growthAction: 'Match their energy level. Sometimes quiet companionship is more connecting than enthusiastic discussion.'

      ]
    },
    
    researchInsight: {
      core: 'Your approach aligns with research on the social nature of literacy and the importance of "relatedness" in Self-Determination Theory. Shared reading experiences do build stronger reading identities and family bonds.',
      caution: 'Research also shows that individual differences matter greatly. Some children are more socially motivated than others, and pushing connection can backfire with children who prefer independence.'

          challenge: 'You might dismiss "light" reading as less valuable',
          insight: 'Your appreciation for meaningful books can sometimes lead to subtle devaluing of fun, escapist, or series reading that children love.',
          growthAction: 'Remember that building reading stamina and joy through "easy" books often leads to readiness for deeper texts later. Fun reading has its own important purpose.'
        },
        {
          challenge: 'Children may feel like their interpretations aren\'t sophisticated enough',
          insight: 'Your comfort with complex ideas can sometimes make children feel like their simpler responses aren\'t good enough.',
          growthAction: 'Start with their level of meaning-making. A seven-year-old saying "The character was sad like me when my dog died" is profound meaning-making for that age.'

      ]
    },
    
    researchInsight: {
      core: 'Your approach aligns with research on "transformative learning" and the role of literature in identity development. Stories do help children understand themselves and develop moral reasoning.',
